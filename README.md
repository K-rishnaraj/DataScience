# DataScience 

## Task Topic

** You are a data science consultant. Your client company has a dataset and a bunch of business **
questions. Therefore, you are required to build an explanatory data analysis pipeline in a
Jupyter Notebook to answer these business questions. Your designed and implemented pipeline
will be submitted to your client company. 

The notebook should contain the following information:

. The business context. For example, who is your client company? What kind of data do
they have? Why do they need you as a data scientist?
. A data exploration discussion on the characteristics of the given dataset. For example,
does the dataset suffer from any data quality issues? What are the most interesting
metadata?
. The data preprocessing step. For example, how do you clean the dataset before the main
analysis?
. The explanatory data analysis part. Define 5-10 interesting business questions and
answer them. The questions should be diverse and require different Python/Pandas
skills/features. So, please make sure that, overall, the submitted Jupyter notebook showcases
your in-depth Python programming skills. Define genuine business questions that
you are personally interested in, not some trivial questions that are easy to answer. For
example, these business questions could be “What time could be the best time to display
our advertising to customers?”, “What product combinations were most often sold?”, etc.
For each business question do the following:
– Add a new subsection in the Jupyter Notebook;
– Explain the importance of this query for the business;
– Write a code cell including Python codes to find the answer;
– Add a text cell to explain your Python code, elaborate on the result, and how it
answers the original business question.
. A final discussion and conclusion. For example, what are the overall strengths and limitations
of your explanatory data analysis? What are the insights and implications of
2
the results for the business? What are your data-driven recommendations for your client
company?
